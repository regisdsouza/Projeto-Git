Basically testing those commands on git and learning their usage 

**git init** - helps to create a git repository 

**git status** - displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git

**git add + "name of archive"** - The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.

**git add .** - to add all archives 

**git commit -m "comment"** - for example: initial commit

**git config --global user.email "gmail"** (from GitHub)

**git config --global user.name "username"**

**git push**  -  is used to upload local repository content atualization to a remote repository

Here do you need to create a repository in GitHub to allocate the project

Get The URL then 

**git remote add origin + "URL"** - is used to send the code remotely 

**git reflog** - used to see the history of atualizations 

**git branch** - to see all branch 

**git branch + "name"** - to add a branch 

**git checkout + "name of the branch"** - change the branch 

**git merge + "name of the branch"** -  used to integrate changes from one branch into another.

**touch .gitignore** - used to instruct the version control system on which files or directories should be ignored when changes are staged or committed.
